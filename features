Smart Contract: Implement a smart contract on a blockchain platform (such as Ethereum) to store and manage the certificate data. The smart contract should include functions for certificate issuance, verification, and revocation.

Certificate Issuance: Users should be able to issue digital certificates by providing relevant information, such as the recipient's details, certificate title, issuer details, and any additional metadata. The certificate data should be securely stored on the blockchain.

Certificate Verification: The system should provide a user-friendly interface for verifying certificates. Users can input a certificate's unique identifier or upload the certificate file, and the system will verify its authenticity by checking the corresponding entry on the blockchain.

Revocation Mechanism: Implement a revocation mechanism that allows the issuer to revoke a certificate if it is found to be fraudulent or if the recipient's credentials have changed. Revoked certificates should be marked as invalid and flagged during the verification process.

User Interface: Develop a web-based interface that allows users to interact with the blockchain system. The interface should provide options for issuing certificates, verifying certificates, and viewing certificate details.
